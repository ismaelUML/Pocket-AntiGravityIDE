## [1.8.0] - 2026-10-07

### 🛑 Remote Turn Abort (Ctrl + D), Live Tool Calls & Mobile Haptics
- **Native OS Remote Turn Cancellation (`Ctrl + D`)**:
  - Added Win32 P/Invoke automation (`src/infrastructure/automation/native/abort-injector.ps1`) targeting Antigravity IDE (`Chrome_WidgetWin_1`).
  - Synthesizes `VK_CONTROL` (`0x11`) + `VK_D` (`0x44`) via `keybd_event` to abort agent turns immediately from phone.
  - Added REST endpoint `POST /api/prompt/abort` protected by HMAC PIN verification.
  - Pulsing `🛑 Stop` button in mobile chat view with toast notifications and haptic feedback.
- **Live Activity Stream & Real-Time Tool Calls**:
  - Expanded `chat-view.js` to render `step.toolCalls` in real-time, eliminating dead screens during tool execution.
  - Dedicated badges for `run_command` (💻), `view_file` (📄), edits (✏️), and searches (🔍) with pulsing activity indicators.
- **Haptic Feedback & Web Audio Notifications**:
  - Integrated `public/js/sound-notifier.js` synthesizing soft harmonic chimes (880Hz -> 1320Hz) via native Web Audio API with zero audio files.
  - Tactile mobile vibration alerts (`navigator.vibrate([150, 80, 150])`) when agent turns finish or working tree diffs change.
  - Toggle button in header (`🔔` / `🔕`) with persistence in `localStorage`.
- **Mobile Screen Wake-Lock**:
  - Added `public/js/wake-lock.js` using `navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')` to prevent mobile displays from going to sleep during long tasks.
  - Status toggle (`👁️`) in header with automatic re-lock on visibility change.
- **Quick Action Slash Commands Bar**:
  - Docked quick action chips above mobile input: `📋 /plan`, `❓ /grill-me`, `🧪 Run Tests`, `↩️ Discard Changes`, `💡 Explain Simply`.
- **Automated Tests**:
  - Added `tests/unit/abort-prompt.test.js` verifying `IdeAutomationPort.abortCurrentTurn()` and `POST /api/prompt/abort` (101/101 tests passing).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-12

### 🎛️ Desktop Host Control Center & Mobile PWA
- **Desktop Control Center Hub (`public/dashboard/`)**:
  - Standalone Discord/VirtualBox-inspired dark dashboard hosted at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
  - Windowed App Mode launcher (`bin/dashboard.bat` or `npm run dashboard`) running in Edge/Chrome with zero extra Electron/Tauri bloat.
  - **System Doctor Widget**: Automated environment inspection checking Node.js runtime, Git CLI, Windows PowerShell, and Antigravity IDE active process with real-time status badges.
  - **Network & Access Hub**: Automatic local IP resolution (`os.networkInterfaces()`) for direct Local Wi-Fi (0ms lag) pairing with instant high-resolution SVG QR code generation.
  - **On-Demand Public Tunnel Toggle**: 1-Click start/stop switch for Cloudflare Tunnel with Localtunnel fallback and dynamic public QR code rendering.
  - **Settings & Host Builder**: Visual PIN editor, port configuration, default persona selector, and Windows Keep-Awake toggle.
  - **Windows Power Management**: Kernel execution state toggle (`SetThreadExecutionState`) preventing the host PC from going to sleep during remote mobile sessions.
  - **Live Host Telemetry**: Real-time connected mobile client counter, memory consumption, server uptime, and event stream.
- **Mobile Progressive Web App (PWA)**:
  - Added Web App Manifest (`public/manifest.json`) and iOS standalone meta tags for full-screen, native-feeling installation without building an APK.
  - Offline shell caching via Service Worker (`public/sw.js`) with stale-while-revalidate for assets and pass-through for WebSockets/APIs.
  - Integrated `PwaManager` (`public/js/pwa.js`) handling install prompts (`beforeinstallprompt`) and standalone mode detection.
- **Automated Tests**:
  - Added comprehensive test suite (`tests/unit/system.test.js`, `tests/unit/dashboard-endpoints.test.js`) verifying diagnostics, network resolution, config persistence, and PWA assets (26/26 tests passing).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-12

### 🏛️ Architecture Refinement, Security Hardening & Performance
- **Folder Structure Refinement**:
  - Consolidated all launcher and access scripts into `bin/` (`bin/start.bat`, `bin/stop.bat`, `bin/start-tunnel.js`).
  - Safe `stop.bat` targets specifically the PID on port 3000 and matching titled windows, preventing collateral termination of other local Node.js processes.
  - Isolated native Win32 PowerShell automation scripts into `src/infrastructure/automation/native/`.
- **Security & Data Safety Hardening**:
  - Enforced 24-hour token expiration and timing-safe cryptographic verification in `pin-auth.js`.
  - Added in-memory rate-limiting lockout (5 failed PIN attempts locks authentication for 5 minutes).
  - Decoupled Express middleware into `src/interfaces/http/middleware/auth.middleware.js` to eliminate leaky infrastructure abstractions.
  - Replaced destructive `git clean -fd` in `git.adapter.js` with non-destructive stash backup (`git stash push --include-untracked`) before restoring.
  - Preserved existing desktop clipboard contents in `clipboard-injector.ps1` before and after prompt paste.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Eliminated continuous 3-second UIAutomation tree crawling in `websocket-server.js` in favor of event-driven and on-demand updates.
- **Browser-Native Frontend Modularization**:
  - Decomposed monolithic 867-line `app.js` into focused ES modules under `public/js/` (`auth.js`, `ws-client.js`, `views/chat-view.js`, `views/diff-view.js`, `views/files-view.js`, `main.js`) with zero build dependencies.
- **Automated Test Suite (`tests/`)**:
  - Added unit test suite for auth security, persona transformations, and git diff parsing using Node's native test runner (`node --test`).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-03

### 🎭 Multi-Assistant & Custom Agent Personas (Issue #2)
- **Persona Domain Entity (`src/core/domain/persona.js`)**: Encapsulates persona identity, role directives, slash commands, and prompt transformation logic.
- **Curated Built-in Catalog**:
  - `⚡ Pair Dev`: Direct, concise, production-ready coding.
  - `🔍 Reviewer`: Strict code auditing for security, edge cases, and performance.
  - `📐 Architect`: Focuses on clean/hexagonal architecture, interfaces, and separation of concerns.
  - `🐛 Bug Hunter`: Systematic root-cause debugging, logging, and minimal fixes.
  - `🎯 Autonomous Goal`: Prepends `/goal` command for autonomous completion of complex goals.
  - `💡 Teacher`: Clear conceptual explanations, design tradeoffs, and mental models.
- **Prompt Enrichment (`SendPromptUseCase`)**: Transparently enriches short mobile inputs with expert role directives before injecting into Antigravity IDE.
- **Mobile Persona Selector UI**:
  - Horizontal scrolling persona chips bar in mobile header.
  - Active persona badge indicator docked above the mobile input field.
  - Local preference persistence in `localStorage`.
- **REST API (`src/interfaces/http/routes/personas.routes.js`)**: Endpoints to list personas (`GET /api/personas`) and persist custom agent configurations (`POST /api/personas/custom`).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-02

### 🏛️ Hexagonal & Clean Architecture Refactoring
- **Core Domain Entities (`src/core/domain/`)**: Pure business models (`Prompt`, `Session`, `FileDiff`, `WorkspaceChanges`) independent of frameworks or OS.
- **Application Use Cases (`src/core/usecases/`)**: Decoupled orchestrators (`SendPromptUseCase`, `ReviewChangesUseCase`, `ManageSessionsUseCase`).
- **Port Contracts (`src/core/ports/`)**: Clean interfaces for `IdeAutomationPort`, `VcsPort`, and `TranscriptPort`.
- **Secondary Infrastructure Adapters (`src/infrastructure/`)**:
  - `Win32AutomationAdapter`: OS window management and P/Invoke keyboard synthesis.
  - `GitAdapter`: Native Git CLI working tree inspection, staging, and rollback.
  - `JsonlTranscriptAdapter`: Incremental `.jsonl` brain log tailing and session discovery.
- **Primary Interface Adapters (`src/interfaces/`)**:
  - Modular Express routes (`auth.routes.js`, `changes.routes.js`, `sessions.routes.js`, `workspace.routes.js`, `prompt.routes.js`).
  - `WebSocketServerHandler`: Reactive streaming adapter.
- **Composition Root (`src/server.js`)**: Pure dependency injection container and application bootstrap.
